JsCalcTdd - TDD proof of concept project for minimalist TDD for Js
==================================================================
This is a proof of concept that shows how to write unit tests for
Javascript when we are not allowed to download tools like JsUnit.

These examples are useful because they show how to run the JavaScript
tests with the usual JUnit test harness tools.

The project requires java 6 or higher.

For the sake of simplicity it's an eclipse project. Automatic build
tools like ant or maven are not supported yet.
